							<h5>Adolf Hirémy-Hirschl &nbsp;&nbsp;(1898)</h5>
							<p>Hirémy-Hirschl was a Hungarian artist known for his historical and mythological paintings. At an early age he went to Vienna, Italy to study before receiving a scholarship to attend the Akademie der bildenden Künste. He later moved to Rome where he spent 35 years painting, culminating in over 70 works created. Not much is known about most of his major pieces though, as some were lost or retained by his heirs.</p>

							<h5>Briton Rivière &nbsp;&nbsp;(1888)</h5>
							<p>Rivière was a british artist renowned for his paintings of animals. He was trained by his father, who was an art teacher at the University of Oxford. When asked how he goes about painting dogs, he responded with "I have always been a great lover of dogs but I have worked at them so much that I've grown tired of having them about me. However, you can never paint a dog unless you are fond of it." Requiescat is a latin word which translates to "rest in peace".</p>

							<h5>Thomas Cole &nbsp;&nbsp;(1836)</h5>
							<p>Cole was an American landscape painter who is often regarded as the founder of the Hudson River School art movement. This painting comes from a series of his, titled The Course of Empire. The series consists of five paintings depicting the rise and fall of a fictional city. Consummation is the third work in the series. In his own words, he describes the scene as "the summit of human glory".</p>

							<h5>John Constable &nbsp;&nbsp;(1825)</h5>
							<p>This painting was commissioned by John Fisher, the Bishop of Salisbury, and painted by John Constable. Constable was an English landscape painter, though his work was more appreciated in France, than his own country. He is credited with revolutionizing the genre of landscape painting and is considered one of the last "old masters". He once told his friend, "when I sit down to make a sketch from nature, the first thing I try to do is to forget that I have ever seen a picture".</p>

							<h4 style="margin: 2700px 0px 0px 0px; font-size: 62px">Springtime</h4>
							<h5>Pierre Auguste Cot &nbsp;&nbsp;(1873)</h5>
							<p>Cot was a French painter who studied under other distinguished artists like Leon Cogniet, Alexandre Cabanel and William-Adolphe Bouguereau. Springtime was first exhibited at the 1873 Paris salon, where it was well received. The painting would go on to become Cot's most successful work of art, and was often copied in other mediums. One source described the couple, who are seemingly captivated by each other, as "drunken with first love".</p>
